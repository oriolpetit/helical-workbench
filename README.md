# Helical Workbench

Helical Workbench is a platform for running bioinformatics model inference
using [Helical](https://github.com/helical-ai/helical) genomic foundation models. It provides a web
interface for submitting inference jobs and exploring results — no programming knowledge required.

## What's Available

- **Web interface** — Submit and manage model inference jobs through a browser-based UI
- **Model inference pipeline** — Run genomic foundation models (e.g. Geneformer) on datasets from
  HuggingFace
- **Results explorer** — View and download embeddings generated by the models

## Requirements

The only requirement is **Docker**. Install it for your operating system by following the official
instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Getting Started

### Start the platform

From the root of this repository, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will download and start all necessary services. The first run may take several minutes.

### Open the platform

Once all services are running, open your browser and go to:

**[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Stop the platform

When you are done, stop all services by running:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

If something is not working as expected, you can inspect the pipeline execution at:

**[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

This opens the Airflow dashboard, which shows the status of each pipeline run and any error logs.
Default credentials are `airflow` / `airflow`.
